# My Mood Diary - Express/MongoDB version

This is an express.js REST API using MongoDB Atlas which is a Javascript version of my other REST API in Python Flask. You will need to create a MongoDB Atlas collection and a .env file with DB_CONNECTION as the URI to your database, as shown in the .env.example file.
